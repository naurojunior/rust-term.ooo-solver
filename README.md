Learning rust, just making random stuff

First of all, the idea behind this is just baby steps on Rust, just checking sintax, playing a little, breaking stuff...

The second objective is:

- [X] Download dictionary that Term.ooo uses
- [X] Generate a 5 words only dictionary
- [X] Make some kind of input to understand the rules (excluded letters, misplaced letters and correct letters)
- [X] Make rules to exclude words that have the letter removed
- [ ] Make rules to only accept words with correct place of the letter
- [ ] Make rules to mess with misplaced letters
- [ ] Guess what the words can be... maybe help guessing which word to try next.
